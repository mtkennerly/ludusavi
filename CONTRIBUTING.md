## Development

### Prerequisites

Use the latest version of Rust.

On Linux, you'll need some additional system packages.
Refer to [the installation guide](/docs/help/installation.md) for the list.

### Commands

- Run program:
  - `cargo run`
- Run tests:
  - One-time setup:
    - Windows:
      ```
      reg import tests/ludusavi.reg
      cd tests/root3/game5
      mklink /J data-symlink data
      ```
    - Other:
      ```
      cd tests/root3/game5
      ln -s data data-symlink
      ```
  - `cargo test`
- Activate pre-commit hooks (requires Python) to handle formatting/linting:
  ```
  pip install --user pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

### Environment variables

These are optional:

- `LUDUSAVI_VERSION`:
  - If set, shown in the window title instead of the Cargo.toml version.
  - Intended for CI.
- `LUDUSAVI_VARIANT`:
  - If set, shown in the window title in parentheses.
  - Intended for alternative builds, such as using different Iced renderers.

### Icon

The master icon is `assets/icon.kra`, which you can edit using
[Krita](https://krita.org/en) and then export into the other formats.

### Release preparation

Commands assume you are using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com) on Windows.

#### Dependencies (one-time)

```bash
pip install invoke
cargo install cargo-lichking

# Verified with commit ba58a5c44ccb7d2e0ca0238d833d17de17c2b53b:
curl -o /c/opt/flatpak-cargo-generator.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/master/cargo/flatpak-cargo-generator.py
pip install aiohttp toml
```

Also install the Crowdin CLI tool manually.

#### Process

- Update version in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Update version in `Cargo.toml`
- Update version in `assets/linux/com.mtkennerly.ludusavi.metainfo.xml`
  and `assets/flatpak/com.github.mtkennerly.ludusavi.metainfo.xml`,
  including the `releases` section and the screenshot URL.
- Run `invoke prerelease`
  - If you already updated the translations separately,
    then run `invoke prerelease --no-update-lang`
- Update the translation percentages in src/lang.rs
- Run `cargo build` to update the version in Cargo.lock
- Add the new version to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yaml`.
- Update the documentation if necessary for any new features.
  Check for any new content that needs to be uncommented (`<!--`).
- Run `git add` for all relevant changes
- Run `invoke release`
  - This will create a new commit/tag and push them.
  - Manually create a release on GitHub and attach the workflow build artifacts
    (plus `dist/*-legal.zip`).
    For Linux and Mac, extract the `.tar.gz` files from the `.zip` files.
- Run `cargo publish`
- Run `invoke release-flatpak`
  - This will automatically push a branch to https://github.com/flathub/com.github.mtkennerly.ludusavi .
  - Manually open a PR for that branch.
  - After the PR is merged, publish via https://buildbot.flathub.org/#/apps/com.github.mtkennerly.ludusavi .
- Run `invoke release-winget`

  - When the script opens VSCode and pauses,
    manually edit `manifests/m/mtkennerly/ludusavi/${VERSION}/mtkennerly.ludusavi.locale.en-US.yaml`
    to add the `ReleaseNotes` and `ReleaseNotesUrl` fields:

    ```yaml
    ReleaseNotes: |-
      <copy/paste from CHANGELOG.md>
    ReleaseNotesUrl: https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/releases/tag/v${VERSION}
    ```

    Close the file, and the script will continue.

  - This will automatically push a branch to a fork of https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs .
  - Manually open a pull request for that branch.
