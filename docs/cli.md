## `find --help`

```
Find game titles

Precedence: Steam ID -> GOG ID -> Lutris ID -> exact names -> normalized names. Once a match is
found for one of these options, Ludusavi will stop looking and return that match, unless you set
`--multiple`, in which case, the results will be sorted by how well they match.

If there are no matches, Ludusavi will exit with an error. Depending on the options chosen, there
may be multiple matches, but the default is a single match.

Aliases will be resolved to the target title.

This command automatically updates the manifest if necessary.

Usage: ludusavi.exe find [OPTIONS] [NAMES]...

Arguments:
  [NAMES]...
          Look up game by an exact title. With multiple values, they will be checked in the order
          given. Alternatively supports stdin (one value per line)

Options:
      --api

          human-readable output

      --multiple
          Keep looking for all potential matches, instead of stopping at the first match

      --path <PATH>
          Directory in which to find backups. When unset, this defaults to the restore path from the
          config file

      --backup
          Ensure the game is recognized in a backup context

      --restore
          Ensure the game is recognized in a restore context

      --steam-id <STEAM_ID>
          Look up game by a Steam ID

      --lutris-id <LUTRIS_ID>
          Look up game by a Lutris slug

      --normalized
          Look up game by an approximation of the title. Ignores capitalization, "edition" suffixes,
          year suffixes, and some special symbols. This may find multiple games for a single input

      --fuzzy
          Look up games with fuzzy matching. This may find multiple games for a single input

## `api --help`

```
Execute bulk requests using JSON input.

If there is a problem with the entire input (e.g., malformed JSON or an invalid top-level setting),
then this will return a non-zero exit code. However, if the problem occurs while processing an
individual request, then the exit code will be zero, and the request's associated response will
indicate its error.

Some top-level errors, like an invalid CLI invocation, may result in a non-JSON output. However,
exit code zero will always use JSON output.

Use the `schema` command to see the input and output format.

Usage: ludusavi.exe api [INPUT]

Arguments:
  [INPUT]
          JSON data - may also be passed via stdin

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```

          `cloud upload`, `cloud download`)
  help
