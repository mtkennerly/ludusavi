# Filter
You can click the filter icon at the top of the backup/restore screens to use some filters.
While these filters are active,
Ludusavi will only back up or restore the games that are currently listed.

You can apply filters for the following:

* Whether the game title matches a search.
* Whether multiple games have the same save files:
  * `Unique` (no conflicts)
  * `Duplicated` (conflicts exist)
* Whether all save files for a game are enabled for processing:
  * `Complete` (all saves enabled)
  * `Partial` (some saves disabled)
* Each game's status:
  * `New` (game has new saves)
  * `Updated` (game has updated saves)
  * `Unchanged` (game has no changes)
  * `Unscanned` (game has not been scanned yet, but is still is history)
* Whether the game itself is enabled for processing:
  * `Enabled` (checkbox next to game is checked)
  * `Disabled` (checkbox next to game is unchecked)
* Game data source:
  * `Primary manifest` (Ludusavi's main game list)
  * `Custom games` (your custom entries)
  * Any secondary manifest you've added on the "other" screen
