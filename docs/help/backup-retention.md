# Backup retention

In the "other" screen's backup section,
you can configure how many backups to keep.
A full backup contains all save data for a game,
while a differential backup contains just the data that has changed since the last full backup.

When Ludusavi makes a new backup for a game, it will also remove any excess backups for that specific game.
When a full backup is deleted, its associated differential backups are deleted as well.

For example, if you configure a retention limit of 2 full and 2 differential,
then Ludusavi will create 2 differential backups for each full backup, like so:

- Backup #1: full
  - Backup #2: differential
  - Backup #3: differential
- Backup #4: full
  - Backup #5: differential
  - Backup #6: differential

When backup #7 is created, because the full retention is set to 2,
Ludusavi will delete backups 1 through 3.

If your full retention is only 1 and your differential retention is 1+,
then Ludusavi will keep the full backup and just delete the oldest differential as needed.

On the restore screen, you can use the three-dot menu next to a game to lock any of its backups.
Locked backups do not count toward the retention limits and are retained indefinitely.
