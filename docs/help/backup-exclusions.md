# Backup exclusions

Backup exclusions let you set paths and registry keys to completely ignore
from all games. They will not be shown at all during backup scans.

Configure exclusions on the "other" screen.

For excluded file paths, you can use glob syntax.
For example, to exclude all files named `remotecache.vdf`, you would specify `**/remotecache.vdf`.
