# Selective scanning
Once you've done at least one full scan (via the preview/backup buttons),
Ludusavi will remember the games it found and show them to you the next time you run the program.
That way, you can selectively preview or back up a single game without doing a full scan.
Use the three-dot menu next to each game's title to operate on just that one game.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to swap the three-dot menu with some specific buttons:

* preview: shift
* backup/restore: ctrl (Mac: cmd)
* backup/restore without confirmation: ctrl + alt (Mac: cmd + option)

Additionally, [filters](/docs/help/filter.md) can restrict which games are processed.
