## Unreleased

* Added:
  * Ludusavi now shows which games and files are new/changed compared to the last backup or restore.
    This is indicated by a `+` or `Î”` badge next to applicable games and files.
  * The Heroic launcher is now supported as a root type.
    Both GOG and Epic games are detected, as well as any Wine prefixes (on Linux).
    ([Contributed by sluedecke](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/141))
  * Compression levels can now be customized for zip backups.
  * In addition to restoration redirects, there are now also backup redirects and bidirectional redirects.
    The redirect editor is now on the "other" screen instead of the "restore" screen.
  * GUI: On startup, Ludusavi will ask if you'd like to add any missing roots.
    It will remember your choice and won't ask twice for the same root.
  * GUI: The custom games screen now has a button to preview a specific game on demand.
    This lets you preview a custom game even if it's not yet in the backup screen's main list.
  * GUI: When previewing a specific game on demand,
    if it disappears from the list because save data can no longer be found for it,
    then a notification is shown to explain what happened.
  * GUI: The "other" screen now shows when the manifest was last checked/updated.
    There is also a button to refresh on demand.
    While the manifest is updating, a small notification is displayed at the bottom of the window.
  * GUI: Tooltips for some icons that may not be self-explanatory.
  * CLI: `find` command to look up game titles from the manifest.
    This incorporates the `--by-steam-id` option from the `backup`/etc commands
    and adds some new ones, like `--normalized` to look up games by an inexact name.
  * On startup, Ludusavi will prune any useless blank configurations
    (e.g., roots with a blank path).
* Changed:
  * Increased scanning speed by 10% by avoiding some duplicate path lookups.
  * CLI: Deprecated `--by-steam-id` in the `backup`/`backups`/`restore` commands,
    in favor of the new `find` command.
  * Ludusavi will no longer migrate pre-v0.10.0 configurations to the current location.
  * A new `cache.yaml` is now used for some fields from `config.yaml`,
    specifically the recent game caching and manifest update tracking.
  * On startup, Ludusavi will only check for manifest updates if the last check was 24 hours ago or longer.
    Previously, it would check automatically on every startup.
    This was changed to avoid excess network traffic,
    because the manifest itself will be updated much more frequently.
  * GUI: Styling is now more consistent for disabled buttons.
  * GUI: When adding a new root or custom game, the list automatically scrolls to the end.
* Fixed:
  * Backup files did not store the correct modification time on Linux and defaulted to the current time.
    This also affected Windows, but only for zip backups.
    ([Contributed by sluedecke](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/136))
  * Zipped backup files did not store the correct permissions on Linux/Mac.
  * Proton and Wine files are now searched case-insensitively on Linux.
  * When Ludusavi tried to find a rough match for an install folder like "Some Game",
    it did not recognize that "Some - Game" was close enough.
  * GUI: Crash if you started a scan, clicked "find roots", and then clicked "cancel"
    while the scan was still ongoing.
  * GUI: When the manifest finished updating in the background,
    any currently open modal would be closed.
  * CLI mode asked for confirmation when restoring, but backups behaved differently:

    * If the target folder did not exist, then the backup would happen without confirmation.
    * If it did exist, then the `--force` or `--merge` option had to be specified,
      even if you already had merging enabled in your config.

    Now, backups ask for confirmation unless you specify `--force` or `--preview`,
    and the confirmation phrasing is aligned with GUI mode.

## v0.13.1 (2022-09-29)

* Fixed:
  * In GUI mode on windows, an extra console window appeared.
  * In CLI mode, when restoring with redirected paths, the original paths were not shown correctly.

## v0.13.0 (2022-09-28)

* Added:
  * File-based logging in the same directory with the config and manifest files.
    By default, only warnings and errors are logged,
    but you can customize this by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable
    (e.g., `RUST_LOG=ludusavi=debug`).
    The most recent 5 log files are kept, rotating on app launch or when a log reaches 10 MiB.
  * On Windows, `%LocalAppData%/VirtualStore` will be checked for potential matches of:
    * `C:/Program Files`
    * `C:/Program Files (x86)`
    * `C:/ProgramData`
    * `C:/Windows`
  * Updated translations.
    (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))
* Changed:
  * Removed the option to "exclude save locations that have only been confirmed on another operating system"
    (config key: `excludeOtherOsData`). This was primarily meant as an optimization for Windows users,
    but in practice, it made little difference on Windows and would rarely be desired on other platforms,
    leading to confusion.
* Fixed:
  * When looking for game install folders during a full scan,
    Ludusavi did not recognize partial folder name matches.
    ([Investigated by sluedecke][https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/issues/123])
  * When restoring a backup that was made on a different OS,
    it could get stuck before completing the process.
    ([Contributed by Hizoul](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/127))
  * GUI: Window now appears immediately and updates the manifest in the background,
    rather than waiting to show the window until the update is complete.
    If there is no local manifest at all, a loading screen is shown while downloading.

## v0.12.1 (2022-08-31)

* Fixed:
  * Updated translations, including new ones for Esperanto and (experimentally) Korean.
    This was meant to be included in 0.12.0, but was missed during the release preparation.
    (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))

## v0.12.0 (2022-08-31)

* Added:
  * GUI: Dark theme.
  * GUI: On app startup, games found during the most recent scan will be displayed
    in an "unknown" state, allowing you to re-scan any of those specific games
    on demand without doing a full scan of all games. This is especially useful
    if full scans are slower on your system and you just want to back up one game.
  * GUI: Added an option to re-preview a specific game on demand. This and other
    per-game actions have been grouped into a popup menu to save space. You can
    use keyboard shortcuts to convert the menu into some specific shortcuts:
    * preview: shift
    * backup/restore: ctrl (Mac: cmd)
    * backup/restore without confirmation: ctrl + alt (Mac: cmd + option)
  * CLI: `backups` command to list backups for each game,
    and a `--backup` flag to restore a specific backup by ID.
  * On Linux, GOG roots now additionally check for a `game` subfolder when
    parsing the `<base>` and `<game>` placeholders.
    ([contributed by sluedecke](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/121))
  * The Steam root for Flatpak is now auto-detected.
  * If you set the `LUDUSAVI_DEBUG` environment variable, then Ludusavi will
    not detach from the console on Windows. This may be helpful if you want to
    troubleshoot an issue that involves Ludusavi crashing.
* Changed:
  * GUI: You can now use folder pickers while a backup/restore is underway.
  * GUI: If all of a game's files are deselected, then the game will show in the
    same style as a disabled game.
* Fixed:
  * Performance regressions from v0.11.0 related to duplicate detection and root globbing.
  * CLI: `restore --by-steam-id 123` would restore all games with a Steam ID
    instead of just the game with the matching ID 123.
  * CLI: When using `--api`, some non-JSON errors would be printed instead of or
    in addition to the JSON info in certain situations. Now, as long as the CLI
    input itself can be parsed, the output will either be valid JSON or blank.
  * GUI: Cancelling a backup/restore no longer has a long delay.
  * GUI: Doing a full preview, backing up one game, and then doing a full backup
    would trigger a full scan instead of reusing the list from the initial preview.
  * GUI: When backing up a single game by using the button next to its name,
    other games with duplicate files did not update their duplicate status.
  * GUI: When backing up a single game by using the button next to its name,
    if its information changed, then it would immediately re-sort in the list.
    While that made sense, it could be hard to use since you would then have to
    go looking for its new position. Now, the position stays stable unless you
    do a new full scan or manually change the sorting options.

## v0.11.0 (2022-08-20)

* Added:
  * Support for multiple full and differential backups per game.
  * Support for compressed zip backups.
  * Translations for German, Spanish, Filipino, Italian, Polish, and Brazilian Portuguese.
    (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))

    Note that some of these translations are still incomplete. Also, when using some
    translations, GUI sizing may not be optimal, but this will be further refined in the future.

    The following translations have also been added, but only have experimental support
    because of a [technical limitation](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/issues/9).
    You can enable them by editing the config file directly: Arabic (`ar-SA`),
    Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`)
  * During first-time setup, Ludusavi will now automatically detect roots for
    secondary Steam library folders (Windows/Linux/Mac) and non-default Epic
    install folders (Windows).
  * It is now possible to ignore paths for backup across all games
    and/or for specific games.
  * GUI: Button to back up or restore an individual game from the list on demand.
  * GUI: Button to find and add any missing roots. This is the same functionality
    as the automatic first-time setup, but is now available on demand.
  * Option to sort the game list by file size and to reverse the sorting.
  * Support for Prime Gaming roots.
  * Support for globs in root paths.
  * On Windows, the version field is now set in the executable properties.
  * On Windows, the executable icon is now included in the crates.io release as well.
  * CLI: Blank line between games for better readability.
* Fixed:
  * GUI: Unable to start on KDE 5.25.3 when using Wayland.
  * GUI: Performance has been improved generally, including for very large results (1,000+ games).
  * GUI: Unresponsive while deleting the backup directory with `merge` disabled
    if the folder was very large.
  * GUI: Improved spacing/padding consistency between some elements.
  * Removed `/games` from the end of the default Uplay (Ubisoft Connect) root
    paths. The new default is `C:/Program Files/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher`.
  * Crash when launching Ludusavi after the user manually deleted the manifest.
  * If duplicate files were found while a game's file list were already open,
    then the files would not immediately be marked as duplicates until you
    closed and reopened the file list.
* Changed:
  * Localization now uses [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) instead of pure Rust code internally.
    If you'd like to help translate Ludusavi, [check out the Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi).
  * Previously, as an optimization, Ludusavi would remember the games it found
    from its first backup/preview and only re-check those games on subsequent
    backups, until certain configuration changes were made (e.g., adding a root).
    However, this had the side effect that newly installed games may not be
    detected right away without an obvious reason why.

    Now, every preview will trigger a full scan. After a preview, doing a backup
    will only include the games found in the preview. If you then do another
    preview or consecutive backup, then it will be a new full scan. This ensures
    Ludusavi will find newly installed games, but it still optimizes for the
    common case of doing a preview immediately followed by a backup.
  * Previously, when Ludusavi backed up a symlink, the backup would contain a
    normal folder with the symlink's name and copies of any files inside of the
    symlink target. If the symlink target itself were also included in the list
    of things to back up, then the same files would be duplicated (once under
    the original directory name and once under the symlink name).

    Now, Ludusavi will still follow symlinks and back up their targets,
    but it will not back up the symlink itself or duplicate the files.
  * When looking for game install folders, Ludusavi previously checked _either_
    the `installDir` entries from the manifest _or_ the game's name, but never
    both at the same time, leading to some missed saves when the `installDir`
    list was incomplete or was not accurate for all stores.

    Now, Ludusavi applies a heuristic to find any install folder that is
    sufficiently similar to the game's title or any known `installDir` value.
    It picks the best match across all games that the install directory
    could possibly represent.
  * Previously, for Steam roots, Ludusavi assumed that the `<storeUserId>`
    would be a series of numbers. However, for some games, this ID may be from
    another launcher and may not conform to those rules. Now, Ludusavi
    just checks for any text, like it does for non-Steam roots.
  * The `merge` setting is now enabled by default.
  * The app window's minimum size has increased from 640x480 to 800x600.
    It may be returned to 640x480 in the future, but there are currently
    some limitations that make it look poor at that size.
  * GUI: Previously, the overall game/size numbers would stay at the values
    from the last scan, and if you started (de)selecting games, then a separate
    badge would show the game/size totals for the new selection. Now, the main
    numbers update progressively and the badge has been removed.
  * GUI: When you launch the program, if the config file is invalid, it gets
    reset with a default copy. Previously, this would delete the invalid copy
    without any means of getting it back. Now, the invalid copy is renamed to
    `config.invalid.yaml` in case you would like to inspect/fix it.

## v0.10.0 (2021-03-12)

* Added:
  * CLI: `--wine-prefix` option for backups.
  * GUI: Root types are now selected via a dropdown instead of radio buttons.
  * Several new root types have been added for various stores, which will allow
    for better store-specific path detection in the future. There is also a
    special type for custom home folders.
  * Custom games can now be individually disabled.
* Changed:
  * Ludusavi now stores its configuration in a more standard location on each
    operating system, instead of always using `~/.config/ludusavi`.
    ([contributed by micke1m](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/63))

    * Windows: `%APPDATA%/ludusavi`
    * Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ludusavi` or `~/.config/ludusavi`
    * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/ludusavi`

    If you've used an older version, your existing configuration will be moved
    automatically to the new location.
  * GUI: Switched to OpenGL by default and upgraded to [Iced 0.2.0](https://crates.io/crates/iced).
  * GUI: Custom games are now more visually distinct from each other.
* Fixed:
  * The 32-bit Windows executable was not properly compatible with 32-bit
    systems.
  * For Proton and Wine, Ludusavi now looks for multiple variations of a few folders:
    * `<winDocuments>` checks `~/Documents` (in addition to `~/My Documents`).
    * `<winAppData>` checks `~/AppData/Roaming` (in addition to `~/Application Data`).
    * `<winLocalAppData>` checks `~/AppData/Local` and `~/Local Settings/Application Data`
      (instead of `~/Application Data`).

## v0.9.0 (2020-08-30)

* Added:
  * An indication when a single file or registry key will be backed up by
    more than one game.
  * CLI: A `complete` command for generating shell completion scripts.
  * GUI: Info about how many games are selected, if the number is different
    than how many games have been processed in the backup/restore.
  * GUI: An edit button next to each game in backup mode to quickly create
    a custom entry for that game, pre-filled with the default info.
  * GUI: A search option to just see games with matching names.
  * GUI: A button to open a game's PCGamingWiki article so that you can more
    easily review or update its information.
* Changed:
  * GUI: Each game's list of files is now a tree with collapsible folders,
    rather than a plain list of full paths. Performance has also been improved
    for very large lists.
  * GUI: The backup/restore confirmation screen now has some extra text that
    recommends doing a preview first.
* Fixed:
  * When using a custom entry to override a known game, some of the original's
    non-overridable data would not be inherited by the custom entry (namely its
    Steam ID and installation directory name).
  * GUI: If the initial full scan found saves for a game, and then you created
    a custom entry for that game such that no saves would be found, did a scan,
    deleted the custom entry, and did another scan, then that scan would not
    find any files for the game. Now, it will correctly revert to the standard
    data for that game immediately.

## v0.8.0 (2020-08-10)

* Added:
  * If you create a file called `ludusavi.portable` in the same location as
    the executable, then Ludusavi will store its config file and the manifest
    there as well.
* Fixed:
  * Read-only files could only be backed up once, since the original backup
    could not be replaced by a newer copy, and you could not restore a backup
    if the original file was read-only. Now, Ludusavi will try to unset the
    read-only flag on backups before replacing them with newer backups, and
    it will try to unset the flag on target files before restoring a backup.
  * Invalid paths like `C:\Users\Foo\Documents\C:\Users\Foo` would be shortened
    to just `C:\Users\Foo`, which could cause irrelevant files to be backed up.
    Now, the extraneous `C:` will be converted to `C_` so that it simply won't
    match any files or directories.
  * When some games were deselected, the disk space display only showed units
    for the total space, not the used space, which could lead to it showing
    "1.42 of 1.56 GiB", where 1.42 was actually MiB and not GiB.
    Units are now shown for both sides.
* Changed:
  * When backing up or restoring a file, if it already exists with the correct
    content, then Ludusavi won't re-copy it.
  * In GUI mode, Ludusavi now tries to be smarter about when a full scan is
    needed. Previously, every backup and backup preview would trigger a full
    scan. Now, Ludusavi will remember which games it found and only re-scan
    those games (until you change your roots, change the "other" settings,
    or reopen the program).
  * In CLI mode, `--try-update` will use a default, empty manifest if there is
    no local copy of the manifest and it cannot be downloaded.

## v0.7.0 (2020-08-01)

**The backup structure has changed! Read below for more detail.**

* Added:
  * Backup option to exclude save locations that are only confirmed for
    another operating system.
  * Backup option to exclude store screenshots.
  * `--try-update` flag for backups via CLI.
* Fixed:
  * When starting the GUI, if Ludusavi could not check for a manifest update
    (e.g., because your Internet is down), then it would default to an empty
    manifest even if you already had a local copy that was downloaded before.
    Now, it will use the local copy even if it can't check for updates.
* Changed:
  * Backup structure is now human-readable.
  * App window now has a minimum size, 640x480.
    (Note: For now, the crates.io release will not have a minimum size.)
  * File size units are now adjusted based on the size, rather than always using MiB.
    ([contributed by wtjones](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/32))

### New backup structure
Previously, Ludusavi used Base64 to encode game names and original paths when
organizing backups. There were some technical advantages of that approach, but
it was not easy to understand, and there was a technical flaw because Base64
output can include `/`, which isn't safe for folder or file names.

Therefore, Ludusavi now organizes backups like this, in a way that is easier
to read and understand:

```
C:/somewhere/the-backup-folder/
  Game 1 Name/
    mapping.yaml
    registry.yaml
    drive-C/  # drive-0 on Linux and Mac
      Users/
        ...
      Program Files/
        Steam/
          ...
```

The name of each game's folder is as close to the real title as possible,
except for replacing some special characters with `_`. Ultimately, Ludusavi
doesn't care much about the folder name and mainly looks for `mapping.yaml`,
which contains some metadata that Ludusavi needs. If a game has any Windows
registry data to back up, then there will also be a `registry.yaml` file.
Within each drive folder, everything is simply organized exactly like it
already is on your computer.

If you need to restore a previous backup, then please use Ludusavi v0.6.0
to do the restoration first, then migrate to Ludusavi v0.7.0 and create a
new backup.

You can [read more here](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/issues/29)
about the background of this change. Be assured that this sort of disruptive
change is not taken lightly, but may happen in some cases until Ludusavi
reaches version 1.0.0.

## v0.6.0 (2020-07-29)

* Added:
  * Option to merge into an existing backup directory.
  * `--api` flag in CLI mode.
  * `--by-steam-id` flag in CLI mode.
* Fixed:
  * Registry values of type `EXPAND_SZ` and `MULTI_SZ` were converted to `SZ` when restored.
* Changed:
  * On Windows, the program icon is now embedded in the executable so that
    you can see it in the file browser as well.

## v0.5.0 (2020-07-25)

* Added:
  * Support for custom games.
  * Icons for several buttons.
  * An icon for Ludusavi itself.
    (Note: For now, the crates.io release will not show this icon.)
  * Support for cutting in text fields.
    (Note: For now, the crates.io release will copy text instead of cutting it.)
  * More buttons for browsing folders.
  * Support for `~` (user home directory) in redirects.
  * Support for `.` and `..` path segments when the path does not exist.
* Fixed:
  * On Windows, long paths can now be backed up without issue.
  * When backing up files, the Base64-encoded name now preserves the original
    file's actual capitalization, rather than the expected capitalization
    from the manifest.
  * There was a rare issue related to the above point where some files could be
    backed up twice, once with the original capitalization and once with the
    expected capitalization.
  * The CLI required the backup `--path` to already exist.
  * Keyboard shortcuts didn't work in redirect fields.
  * Registry keys were not backed up if the parent key had no values.
  * CLI mode would panic when restoring if a non-Base64-encoded file were
    present in the source folder. Now, such files will be reported as an error.
* Changed:
  * The configuration auto-save is now more predictable. All config changes
    are now saved immediately.
  * When a game has registry data to back up, registry.yaml no longer includes
    unnecessary fields and is now sorted alphabetically. This means that identical
    registry content will produce an identical registry.yaml across backups.
  * The progress bar is now shown on all screens.

## v0.4.0 (2020-07-21)

* Added the ability to select and deselect specific games.
* Added the ability to restore to different folders via redirects.
* Added indicators for how much disk space is used by the files.
* Added indicators in the GUI when files fail to process.
* Added a browse button for folders.
* Replaced the "=> Restore" and "=> Backup" buttons with a navigation bar.
* Redesigned the confirmation and error screens so that the buttons are shown
  below the text, which helps to prevent any accidental clicks before reading.
* Narrowed how Steam IDs are substituted in paths to avoid false positives.
* Fixed an issue where restore mode in the GUI would get stuck showing an
  "in progress" state if the source path had no subdirectories.

## v0.3.0 (2020-07-12)

* Added command line interface.
* Added common roots for GOG Galaxy on Windows.
* Added copy/undo/redo shortcuts in text fields. Cutting is not yet supported
  because of some limitations in the GUI library.
* Changed scrollbar style so that it's more obvious what's scrollable.
* Changed build process to avoid potential "VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found"
  error on Windows.

## v0.2.0 (2020-07-06)

* Added core backup/restore functionality.
* Added support for saves in the Windows registry.
* Added support for Steam + Proton saves.
* Added support for Steam screenshots.

## v0.1.0 (2020-06-20)

* Initial release.
* Just a prototype/mock-up and not yet functional.
